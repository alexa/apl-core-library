/**
* Public facing API for Alexa Extensions
*
* Extensions are optional enhancements to a runtime that provide additional sources of data,
* commands, and event handlers. Extensions must be explicitly requested before they are made
* available.  The extension user must ask for each extension that it is interested in and then
* check to see if the requested extension is available on that runtime.
*
* Each extension version has a unique URI. The URI is defined by the extension author. Extension
* authors should follow RFC-3986 Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax when
* specifying the URI of an extension.  A sample extension URI that defines version 1.0 of a
* feature for the Alexa platform, may look like:
*                     alexaext:myfeature:10
