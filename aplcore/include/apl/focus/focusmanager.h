/**
 * Class that allows to control APL focus and perform Spatial Navigation.
 * Runtime should use APIs exposed in @see RootContext to pass and acquire focus from APL controlled area.
 * In order to pass focus to APL core runtime should:
 * 1. Retrieve focusable areas using RootContext::getFocusableAreas()
 * 2. Pass received areas through runtime specific focus navigation processing algorithm and find
 *    appropriate one.
 * 3. Pass ID corresponding to chosen area along with focus movement direction and origin focused
 *    area brought to APL viewhost coordinate space to RootContext::setFocus().
 * 4. APL Core will respond with EventType::kEventTypeFocus containing reference to focused component
 *    and actually focused area.
 *
 * In order to directly request core to switch focus in any particular direction (in response to
 * accessibility system finishing read out of current item or any other platform-specific reason)
 * RootContext::nextFocus() should be used with an appropriate direction.
 *
 * In order to take focus from APL (in case if some other component was directly actioned (touched),
 * for example) runtime should call RootConfig::clearFocus(). It's always succeeds and no confirmation
 * event sent.
 *
 * In case if focus changed internally due to commands or Spatial Navigation
 * EventType::kEventTypeFocus will be sent with corresponding parameters.
 *
 * In case if focus needs to be released internally due to commands or Spatial Navigation
 * EventType::kEventTypeFocus will be sent without component reference which runtime should resolve
 * with true in case if focus should leave APL area of control and false if it should stay where it is.
