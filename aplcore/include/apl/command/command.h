/**
 * Generic command definition.  A command is an abstract entity that contains
 * one or more APL primitive commands to be executed in some order with delays.
 *
 * The tricky part to get right is that those primitive commands execute in a
 * constructed Context which has bindings for source and target properties. These
 * bindings are evaluated right before the command is executed so that they
 * reflect the current state of the components.  For example, a command could
 * contain a sequence of primitive "SetValue" commands each of which toggle
 * the checked state of a component between checked and unchecked.
 *
 * The net result is that each command generally holds the raw data and defers
 * constructing the detailed action to be performed until it is explicitly
 * required.
