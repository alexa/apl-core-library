/**
 * The LayoutManager keeps track of which components have properties that have changed and need to have
 * their layout recalculated.
 *
 * Each Component has a Yoga node.  In most cases the Yoga node is attached to a parent (owner) node.
 * When the node is marked "dirty" (that is, when a Yoga property on the node has changed), the dirty
 * flag is propagated up through the node hierarchy to the top node.  Note that adding and removing Yoga nodes
 * does NOT dirty the Yoga hierarchy.  Any time you add or remove a component, you need to inform the
 * layout manager.
 *
 * The top node in the hierarchy has a Yoga "dirtied_" function attached to it.  When the dirty flag
 * reaches a node with a "dirtied_" function, it calls the LayoutManager and passes the component that owns
 * the node.  The LayoutManager maintains an ordered list of components that have the dirty flag.  The
 * RootContext "clearPending()" method checks that LayoutManager to see if any components are dirty and
 * executes any pending layouts.
 *
 * There are two cases where a component may have a node that is NOT attached to a parent.
 *
 * Case #1: Children of a Pager
 *
 * A Pager does not lay out its children using the Flexbox algorithm.  Instead, each child is placed at
 * the top-left corner of the Pager (rather like absolute positioning).  Each child node is assigned a Yoga
 * "dirtied_" function which informs the LayoutManager if the Pager child needs to be laid out.  If the
 * Pager itself changes size, the LayoutManager is informed that the children need to be laid out.
 *
 * Case #2: Children of a Sequence or GridSequence (MultiChildScrollableComponent)
 *
 * Sequences can support an infinite number of children.  Instead of laying out all of the children,
 * the MultiChildScrollableComponent keeps an "ensured range" of children which have Yoga nodes attached
 * to the node hierarchy.  As the component scrolls the ensured range is updated and additional nodes
 * are attached to the hierarchy.
