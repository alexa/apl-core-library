/**
 * PointerManager holds onto all active pointers.  For touch pointers, these are ephemeral and come and go as users press
 * and lift their fingers.  Mouse pointers persist.
 *
 * Pointer objects are opportunistically created when PointerEvents are received, using the ids contained within those events
 * to either create or retrieve an existing pointer.  It is important that the viewhost ensure that there are no duplicate
 * ids among the set of active pointers.  In order to achieve this, semantics for pointer lifetimes follow the following rules:
 *
 * - The pointer id will be active from an initiating down event (mouse button or press typically) until *either* an associated
 *   lifting or system interruption (e.g. another application's window pops up after a finger comes down on the screen).
 *
 * - Mouse style pointers that can inject move events while unpressed will not be considered "active" and the associated
 *   pointer id will not be cached.  These events will be forwarded along to processing for hover if any is required.

    /**
     * Handles a PointerEvent.  If the pointer has never been seen, it will create a new pointer for the id in the associated
     * event.  The following event types are handled:
     *
     * - Cancel: Occurs when the viewhost indicates that some occurrence has caused the current interaction with this pointer
     *           to be interrupted.  This could be due to loss of window foreground or other similar events.  This is distinct
     *           from the onCancel that the document may issue for a component.  While Cancel here from the viewhost will
     *           result in an onCancel for a touchable component, other events can occur that will cause the component to
     *           handle an onCancel as well (such as a gesture taking over touch handling).
     *
     * - Down:   Occurs when a mouse button is clicked or a touch starts.  The top-most touchable component will be found
     *           and set as the target for this pointer.  The target will persist until a cancel or up event.  All subsequent
     *           events will be routed to the target, regardless of being within that target's bounds or not.
     *
     * - Move:   Occurs while a touch is down and has moved, in this state, a component is generally in the pressed state.
     *           For mouse pointers, this can occur without a preceding down; if the pointer is down, the move events will
     *           be routed to the target previously identified.  If there is either no target, or the pointer is up, move
     *           events will be delegated to hover manager.
     *
     * - Up:     Occurs when a finger is lifted and a touch ends or a mouse button is lifted.  The event will be routed to
     *           the target and if the event occurs within the bounds of the target, a press event will also be fired.  In
     *           all cases, the target will be disassociated from this pointer and the pressed state of the target will be
     *           removed.  For touch type pointers, the pointer will be removed from the manager.
